Feature: Notes Management Across Pages
  As a user
  I want to add multiple notes and manage them
  So that I can see all notes in the Manage List page with their titles and content

  Background:
    Given user goes to "https://testpages.eviltester.com/styled/apps/notes/simplenotes.html"

  Scenario: Add all notes and verify them in Manage List page
    When user adds the following notes:
      | title                     | note                                                                                                 |
      | Grocery List              | Milk, eggs, bread, spinach, chicken breast, peanut butter. Don't forget the dog food!               |
      | Project X Meeting Summary | Decided on the blue color palette. Target launch date moved to Q4. Sarah will handle social media graphics. |
      | Weekend Ideas             | Hiking at Bear Mountain, visit the new bookstore downtown, try that new ramen place, finish painting the guest room. |
      | Book Recommendation       | "The Martian" by Andy Weir. Fast-paced and scientifically interesting. Check the library for availability. |
      | Car Maintenance Log       | Oil change at 85,000 miles. Tire rotation due in 3,000 miles. Replaced wiper blades on 9/28/2025.   |
      | Future Feature Idea       | Add a dark mode toggle to the user profile settings. Need to test accessibility compliance for the new theme. |
      | Favorite Quote            | "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs. A good reminder for Monday mornings. |
      | Recipe: Simple Pasta      | Boil water, cook pasta (8 mins), saut√© garlic in olive oil, toss pasta with sauce, top with basil and Parmesan. |
      | Random Thoughts           | Why is the sky blue? Need to look up how to prune roses. Schedule a dentist appointment for next month. |
      | Important API Key         | kja83ndhT47vBcZ90qLpA6wXrS2uEyD8gI5fO1hJ3mK4 (For testing only - never store real sensitive keys here!) |

    And user clicks Manage List
    Then all notes should be displayed correctly
